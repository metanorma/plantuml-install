= PlantUML installation script

PlantUML is an excellent UML diagram generator.

Unfortunately, it is not provided as a package in older platforms,
such as Ubuntu's 12.04 and 14.04.

This is a script to install it for those platforms that do not
provide native PlantUML packages.

* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)
